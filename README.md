## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-First Approach
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Using web responsive images can be tricky especially because I wasn't using the mobile-first workflow. I had to lookup:

- how to animate hamburger button on click
- how to add JavaScript functionality for interactivity

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning and adapting to how to use svg images and how to adjust them with custom css.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3120739/resizing-svg-in-html) - helped me with resizing svg image filters
- [codepen](https://codepen.io/designcouch/pen/ExvwPY) - creating mobile responsive hamburger menu
